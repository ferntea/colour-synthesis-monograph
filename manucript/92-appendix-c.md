# Appendix C: How to Include CSV Data in Markdown

This appendix explains how to incorporate **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** files into your Markdown documents. Since Markdown does not support embedded spreadsheets, you must use one of several practical methods to present your data clearly and professionally.

The goal is to:
- Display small datasets as readable tables
- Link to full CSV files for download
- Show raw CSV content when needed
- Ensure compatibility with GitHub, VS Code, and Pandoc

## C.1 Method 1: Convert CSV to a Markdown Table (Best for Small Data)

For small datasets (e.g., < 10 rows), convert the CSV into a **Markdown table** for clean in-line display.

### Example CSV:
```csv
Dye,Concentration (%),L*,a*,b*
Red,2.0,50.2,45.1,-10.3
Blue,1.5,48.7,-20.5,35.4
Yellow,3.0,75.3,10.2,65.1
```

| Dye    | Concentration (%) | L*   | a*   | b*   |
|--------|-------------------|------|------|------|
| Red    | 2.0               | 50.2 | 45.1 | -10.3|
| Blue   | 1.5               | 48.7 | -20.5| 35.4 |
| Yellow | 3.0               | 75.3 | 10.2 | 65.1 |

## C.2 Method 2: Link to the CSV File (Best for Large Data)
For large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ rows), do not embed — instead, save the CSV in your project and link to it.

Recommended Folder Structure
color-synthesis-monograph/
├── data/
│   └── dye_database.csv
├── manuscript/
│   └── 92-appendix-c.md

In Your Markdown File
The full dataset with over 200,000 dye triad combinations is available:  
[Download dye_database.csv](../data/dye_database.csv)

On GitHub, this creates a clickable link. Users can view or download the file directly.

## C.3 Method 3: Show CSV as a Code Block (For Syntax Preview)
To show the raw CSV format (e.g., for teaching or debugging), use a fenced code block with the csv language.
### Raw CSV Format
```csv
Dye,Concentration (%),L*,a*,b*
Red,2.0,50.2,45.1,-10.3
Blue,1.5,48.7,-20.5,35.4
Yellow,3.0,75.3,10.2,65.1
```

This displays the CSV in a monospaced font with syntax highlighting (if supported by your Markdown previewer, such as **VS Code with "Markdown Preview Enhanced"**).

## C.4 Best Practices

| Practice | Recommendation |
|--------|----------------|
| **Use tables for small data** | Keep key examples visible in the text |
| **Link to CSV for large data** | Avoid bloating your `.md` files |
| **Name files clearly** | Use `dye_database.csv`, not `data_v2_final.csv` |
| **Include a README in `/data`** | Explain column meanings |
| **Commit to GitHub** | Ensures long-term access and version control |

---

## C.5 Example: Full Integration in a Chapter

In a chapter like `07-database-formulation.md`, you might write:

```markdown
## Example: Dye Triad Database

A sample of the experimental data is shown below:

| Dye 1 | Dye 2 | Dye 3 | L*   | a*   | b*   |
|-------|-------|-------|------|------|------|
| D1    | D5    | D9    | 48.2 | 40.1 | 15.3 |
| D2    | D6    | D10   | 52.7 | -18.4| 33.2 |

The complete dataset (208,594 combinations) is available:  
[Download full_dye_triads.csv](../data/full_dye_triads.csv)

## C.6 Troubleshooting
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Issue                    | Solution                                                  |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Table not rendering      | Ensure pipes `                                            |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Link not working         | Check path: ../data/file.csv (two dots = go up one level) |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| CSV not opening in Excel | Save with UTF-8 encoding and .csv extension               |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| GitHub shows raw CSV     | This is normal — users can still download it              |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

## C.7 Final Tips
- ✅ Use VS Code to preview tables and links
- ✅ Test links in GitHub after pushing
- ✅ Keep your data/ folder organized
- ✅ Use Pandoc to include data in DOCX/PDF exports

With these methods, you can seamlessly integrate structured data into your scholarly writing — making your monograph both scientifically rigorous and practically useful.
